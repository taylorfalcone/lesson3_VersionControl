            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is a system that has the capability to record changes made to files so that specific versions can be recalled later. There are three different types of version control systems: local version control system, centralized version control systems, and distributed version control systems. A local version control system was developed to prevent the common errors that happened with copying the files into another directory, which was the previously used practice. It is used to store files from one local computer. A centralized version control system is used between two different computers, and allows changes to files to be made and saved on each one. Finally, the distributed version control system is where multiple systems communicate constantly, so that if one of them crashes, the data can be easily recovered on one of the others.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git began in the early 2000’s when changes to software were passed around as patches and archived files. In 2005, BitKeeper was developed, which is a distributed version control system. When the company that brought BitKeeper broke down, the once “free of charge” service was revoked. Because of this, the Linux community was forced to come up with a new service with the knowledge that they gained from BitKeeper. They wanted to make sure the service was fast, while maintaining a simple design and strong support for non-linear development. It was also important that it was able to handle large projects like the Linux kernel. Since then Git has been developed into a very easy to use, free service.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">While other version control systems think about their information as a list of file based changes, Git thinks of it more as a series of snapshots. Every time you save your information to Git, it basically takes a snapshot of what all the files look like at that moment. Git is much more than just a version control system, it is a miniature filing service with incredible tools to do things unheard of before this technology. Another important aspect of Git is that it has a level of integrity. No changes can be made to any files without Git knowing about it, so no information can be lost or corrupted.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">You can obtain a Git repository by either taking an existing local directory and turn it into a Git repository, or you can clone an existing Git repository from somewhere else. Initializing the Git repository looks different depending on what system you’re on, so there are multiple different ways to do it. Essentially, you create a new subdirectory that contains all of your files. However, when someone wants to clone an existing repository, then Git receives a whole copy of nearly all the data that is stored on that server. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Recording Changes to a Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">When files are uploaded into the Git directory, it displays a list of all of the files, and a list of the “untracked” files as well. You can also track new files that are added into your Git repository. Once the file is tracked it is staged to be committed, and if you commit at this point then the current snapshot is what will be added to the repository. The working files can be modified but sometimes they are not yet staged. In order to stage a file, you are basically adding this file onto the next saved version of your data. There are many other functions that can be performed with the files stored in the Git repository. Each change is saved to the Git directory when pushed through by the user.</p>
